# files
* EDA.R: This file goes through the initial Exploratory Data Analysis
* QPr.R & QP2.R: These files use spark to utilize the randome forest and gradient boosted tree models
* CrossVal.R: This file cross validates our non-spark models (i.e. Logit & Support Vector Machine)
* CVspark.R, CVsparkReg.R, CV_GAM: These models cross validate the spark models (i.e. Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, and Generalized Additive Models)
